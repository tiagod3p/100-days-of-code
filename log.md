# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Goals: Build projects on python who automatize my tasks, and build a personal portfolio webpage.

### Day 0: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started learn OOP in Python, on this day I learned about class methods, instance method and static method. 

**Thoughts:** I really felt difficult on this first day learning object-oriented programming in python. I have programmed using OOP before, but in Java, and I don't remember much of that. For the next days I will read more and try to do simple projects to consolidate the knowledge.

### Day 1: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I learned about encapsulation and association. I realized that encapsulation in Python is very different than the others programming languages e more simple to understand. 

**Thoughts:** I still feel difficulty to understand some concepts, but I think this difficulty is because I didn't aply those concepts in a project yet. I'm trying to think in some project, when I get it, I'll learn more easier.

### Day 2: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I set aside the studies about OOP and build a twitter bot who fav and rt automatically! I enjoyed too much doing that for more simple as that is. I used this project also to learn about how to use git and github. I made a [repository](https://github.com/tiagod3p/twitter-bot) for this bot and learn how to push a project to github, do changes, etc.

**Thoughts:** I personally felt difficulty to write the readme.md, because I don't know what was expected to be there, so I do my research and found some things that I put on there, and in finally I think it was good!

### Day 3 May 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Well, finally I got to the concept of inheritance in OOP, and I thought it's pretty simple, this day I studied a little bit less because I have too many things to study on university.

**Thoughts:** I need to study more of OOP, to finish and be able to start with django.
