# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Goals: Build projects on python who automatize my tasks, and build a personal á¹•ortfolio webpage.

### Day 0: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started learn OOP in Python, on this day I learned about class methods, instance method and static method. 

**Thoughts:** I really felt difficult on this first day learning object-oriented programming in python. I have programmed using OOP before, but in Java, and I don't remember much of that. For the next days I will read more and try to do simple projects to consolidate the knowledge.
