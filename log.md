# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Goals: Build projects on python who automatize my tasks, and build a personal portfolio webpage.

### Day 0: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started learn OOP in Python, on this day I learned about class methods, instance method and static method. 

**Thoughts:** I really felt difficult on this first day learning object-oriented programming in python. I have programmed using OOP before, but in Java, and I don't remember much of that. For the next days I will read more and try to do simple projects to consolidate the knowledge.

### Day 1: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I learned about encapsulation and association. I realized that encapsulation in Python is very different than the others programming languages e more simple to understand. 

**Thoughts:** I still feel difficulty to understand some concepts, but I think this difficulty is because I didn't aply those concepts in a project yet. I'm trying to think in some project, when I get it, I'll learn more easier.

### Day 2: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I set aside the studies about OOP and build a twitter bot who fav and rt automatically! I enjoyed too much doing that for more simple as that is. I used this project also to learn about how to use git and github. I made a [repository](https://github.com/tiagod3p/twitter-bot) for this bot and learn how to push a project to github, do changes, etc.

**Thoughts:** I personally felt difficulty to write the readme.md, because I don't know what was expected to be there, so I do my research and found some things that I put on there, and in finally I think it was good!

### Day 3 May 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Well, finally I got to the concept of inheritance in OOP, and I thought it's pretty simple, this day I studied a little bit less because I have too many things to study on university.

**Thoughts:** I need to study more of OOP, to finish and be able to start with django.

### Day 4 May 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Multiple inheritance messed with my head! I studied about 2 hours of that to understand,  lol. Now I wanna aply this in a project to really master the knowledge.

**Thoughts:** I think I learn more studying the theory concepts on morning time. I tried to study today after 6PM and wasn't that good. I'll try to study more earlier in the next days.

### Day 5 May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about abstraction classes and abstraction methods in python. I made a small project who consists in create a parent class who simulates a Bank Account, and child classes who simulates the multiple kinds of Bank Account, I used the method withdraw cash as abstraction, and I could learn very much.

**Thoughts:** I'm really enjoying the Challenge, and it's teaching me so much about become a self-taught. I felt multiple difficulties on the day, but I'm not give up, I'll keep with the focus! 

### Day 6 May 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I ended all the basics of OOP and I explored A Guide to Python's Magic Methods to know and understand some of these. I also started a project of a Bank Account like yesterday but more complex. In this new project I pretend to implement all of the topics of OOP that I studied, like Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, etc.

**Thoughts:** Finally I got the first week of the challenge! I'm very happy doing this and I know is very early, but I already feel better than I was.

### Day 7 May 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the project of the Bank Account that I started yesterday, I could apply all the concepts that I defined. I'm very happy for be capable of it. Thanks stackoverflow ðŸ˜‚ 

**Thoughts:** I'm very ansious to start with Django and building real web apps, but I know that I need to understand the concepts well, so I'll keep being patient and in the right time I will start learn Django.

### Day 8 May 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about class Enum, that is very interesting. I also learned about JSON and CSV manipulation with Python, and I tested this concepts creating many file, reading and writing in them.

**Thoughts:** I realized that using JSON and CSV files is very useful, and I know in my career as programmer I'll use those files to do many things, so today was a very good day!

### Day 9 May 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was a day full of problemsðŸ˜‚. I learned about sending emails automatically, webscraping and selenium. To get install the chromedriver to use with brave was very hard, the binnary path wasn't working! I had to install Chrome to work. But even the bugs has some to teach, and I'm grateful for today and all the knowleadge that I got.

**Thoughts:**  I need to focus more on Selenium and Webscraping because I'm very excited to do some python scripts with them.


### Day 10 May 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was the best day of the challenge for me! I built a Python bot who automates that log and I only need to write today's progress and my thoughts. To build the bot I used Selenium. All code is available on [repository](https://github.com/tiagod3p/100-days-of-code-log-bot)

**Thoughts**: I love Selenium!!! It can do amazing bots. I'll certainly do more automating bots with Selenium.


### Day 11 May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started to learn database concepts, I'm using sqlite3 for Python to do that. I learned some basics like CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, etc.

**Thoughts**: I need to study more types of database, sometimes I felt really confused about what I should use.


### Day 12 May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to focus 100% in understand database concepts and I made my only CRUD on Python, and I still don't know nothing lol, I need to study even more, but I know that's the way to learn and improve my skills.

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow I'll start with Django, and while I learn Django, I learn more about databases. I think that using Django and doing some real projects, I'll use all of the concepts I've been studying the past days even more.


### Day 13 May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finally started with Django. Today I learned about how to do my first app and how Django works basically.

### Day 14 May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I still focused on learn Django basics. Now I know how to handle with static files, how to build my templates, etc. I know it's still little but I'll keep studying and improving my knowledge.

**Thoughts**: I'm still thinking about how to build my personal projects in backend without know frontend very well.


### Day 15 May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I stopped my learnings of django to made a python automation bot who sends me an email with my grades of college without me having to update the university site.

**Thoughts**: Doing python bots I have so much fun, it's the best way to learn.


### Day 16 May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Heyy!!! Today I practiced Django by building a contact list integrated with database. In the next days I pretend to improve this project and learn more Django.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed the admin system that django provides. I think it's very useful for real projects.


### Day 17 May 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I was very busy with the college stuff, so I only made some new features for my contact book project like: by clicking in one contact be redirectioned to other page where you'll have more informations about the contact. I know it's not that cool, but for a begginer I believe it's okay, I intend to be better every day.

**Thoughts**: I think some stuff with Django ends up being different from using pure python. I need to familiarize myself with this.


### Day 18 May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to deal with errors and turn them into error 404 on django. I couldn't study too much because the college exams are comming.

**Thoughts**: Is better to study a little every day than a lot just one day!


### Day 19 June 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started to use conditionals on my Django project and learned how to do pagination.

**Thoughts**: I need to train how to do paginations more, and try to use other functions like previous page, next page, only 5 pages range, etc.


### Day 20 June 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started to learn how to train my coding and logic skills on hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: Hackerrank is a pretty cool platform, and I plan to use it everyday to improve my logic skills.


### Day 21 June 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to implement a search field on my django project. It was very difficult but I did it!!! In the end of the day I concluded my studies by doing some hackerrank logic exercises.

**Thoughts**: By training my logic on hackerrank I realized that I'm learning how to code more efficiently.


### Day 22 June 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: What a busy day! Today I did a college exam about general chemistry and learned how to use images integrated with database on django.

### Day 24 June 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent almost 4 hours studying how to implement a login system on my django project. I didn't finish yet 'cause I wanna put some other features.

**Thoughts**: The alert messages that django provides to use is very useful to show error messages. I'm learning so much these past days.


### Day 25 June 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I created two repositories on github. One for my [contact list](https://github.com/tiagod3p/contact-list) project with Django and one for my [new project](https://github.com/tiagod3p/math-algorithms) that I started today using numpy, scipy and matplotlib to create math algorithms.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying so much learn new things every day, Python is an incredible language.


### Day 26 June 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I added some new features to my repository of math algorithms.

**Thoughts**: It's very nice to use the libraries of Python. Numpy, sympy, scipy and matplotlib makes easy to do the algorithms.


### Day 27 June 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I made an algorithm to solve optimization problems using lagrange multiplier. It was very difficult because I had to read very deeply the documentation of scipy.optimize to understand how the library works.

**Thoughts**: Read the documentation of the libraries that I'm using to this project is very important, and helps me to be a better programmer.


### Day 28 June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was a hard day, I got stuck in an exercise of hackerrank and I didn't stop until I got it. When I finally complete the exercise, I was already unwilling to keep doing the problems.

**Thoughts**: I need to know when to stop some exercise to get some fresh air and restart. Today I wasn't very productive because I spent too much time in only one problem.


### Day 29 June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started to build a virtual assistant using the library pyTelegramBotAPI. To start, I implemented a 
functionality who gives the weather forecast of any city.

### Day 32 June 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I added three new functionalities to my virtual assistant: Alert of matches of soccer day by day, currency quotes and variations and alert of trending news of the day.

**Thoughts**: This project is the most cool that I did until now. I'm learning so much libraries, functionalities and having fun.


### Day 33 June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I put my virtual assistant builded with Python at github and started to learn javascript to improve my frontend skills.

**Thoughts**: Javascript is pretty cool, I didn't think it's very different of python, so it was easy to learn the basics.


### Day 34 June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I kept studying javascript, html and css, and start to build my personal portfolio. By doing this I'm learning many things like, manipulate the DOM, css tricks, etc.

### Day 38 June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I got better my instagram bot in Python and kept studying js with node/express. I learned several things like: how to use const variables in frontend, how to use query strings, etc.

**Thoughts**: To improve my study I'm taking notes about every step I made to build my server js with node/express. By doing this I intend to redo everything and try to remember the maximum I can.


### Day 39 June 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished my website of a  portfolio made with node, express, html+css+js containing my electronics projects. I put this project in a [repository](https://github.com/tiagod3p/electronics-portfolio).

**Thoughts**: Web development with Javascript is pretty cool, the idea of build frontend and backend with the same programming language is awesome. I am really tempted to study javascript to be my main language.


### Day 40 June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was a very busy day at work so I only had time to solve some bugs on my instagram bot with Python.

**Thoughts**: I'm studying some stuffs about the software that we are using at work, but I'm still trying to keep the studies about python, javascript and web development.


### Day 41 June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I fixed a bug in my instagram bot, it is almost 100% done. I also started to read the book The Passionate Programmer and I'm already in love with this book.

**Thoughts**: Read programming books is a practice that I have to do more. It's very good to improve my skills and learn with high skilled developers.


### Day 42 June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I implemented the Paypal payment method in the ecommerce that I work. I had to use some javascript functions and read the paypal api documentation. I learned alot.

**Thoughts**: The best part of working with I.T. is the possibility to learn while works.


### Day 43 June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: In my next little project I'll build a system for a school. In this system will be possible to register students, professors, and others employees. Today I started with the html and css.

**Thoughts**: I'll keep doing projects out of work to keep me updated.


### Day 44 June 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I scraped some data to the company that I work. I used python and the libs requests and bs4. My next step is learn how to transform this data in csv and use in excel, libreoffice, etc.

**Thoughts**: This weekend I decided to dive right in javascript. I'll study until I feel exhausted.


### Day 45 June 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I kept working on my project with javascript full-stack. I learned some of css like animations, box-shadow, pseudo-elements, etc. I also discovered the package browser-sync for nodejs.

### Day 56 July 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied more about the DOM in javascript, I learned how to set a class active or not, learned about the function confirm() and how to manipulate events.

**Thoughts**: I like to learn by building projects that forces me to do a lot of research. But I feel that I need to learn some basics after I end the project that I'm building so I won't need to do research about everything.


### Day 57 July 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started with postgresql and postbird as database for my nodejs/express project. I made some configurations and created some tables. 

**Thoughts**: In my last django project I used mariadb, now I will try to use postgres, I hope this change don't be so difficult.


### Day 58 July 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday was the first day since I started the challenge that I don't studied. It was being a busy day at work, I was really tired. But today I studied a lot about nodeJs architectures and databases. I learned how to config postgresql to use with node, how to do query, etc.

**Thoughts**: I need to read more about postgresql and databases, I thought it's very complex to understand well.


### Day 59 July 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I kept studying about database, specifically postgresql for express. I learned how to structure the models folder and how to use the callback functions efficiently.

**Thoughts**: I have too much to learn but I'm feeling so much more capable to do my projects now than when I started the challenge. I'll keep coding every day and I'll evolve much more.


### Day 60 July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied how to use LEFT JOIN to join two related tables in Postgresql. I'll studying more about JOIN tomorrow cause I know that has so much more cases to use it.

**Thoughts**: Integrating a web app with database gives me much more confidence to keep my data safe and know that will be much more difficult for someone get the data.


### Day 61 July 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I put a simple search field in my website project using WHERE ILIKE OR IN LIKE, sql commands. I also started to build a pagination, but I wasn't able to finish cause I'm facing some problems to build the front-end.

**Thoughts**: SQL makes easy to do so much features, I'll study more about it later cause I wanna build systems each more complex.


### Day 62 July 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the pagination of my website! Wow, this was pretty hard. First I learned how to do the logic in javascript to only appear pages close to the selected page. After this, I learned how to show the data in front-end and connect to database.

**Thoughts**: I'll build some little projects of pagination and search field system to fix this knowledge, because it is very connected to database and I don't feel so much confident with SQL.


### Day 63 July 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the project of a site for school management. I improved the pagination I've put on my site. With Javascript I implemented a function who see what page the user selected and add a class 'active' who changes the styles of selected page button.

**Thoughts**: I'll review the site I built in the next days. I'll remember how I implemented the systems and be proficient in it. Maybe I redo everything and improve some parts to fix the knowledge.


### Day 64 July 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I improved my project and fix some bugs. I also created a [repository](https://github.com/tiagod3p/sms) for it, I think this project was the best that I made and who left me more proud. =)

**Thoughts**: Being a programmer and live from coding is my dream. Tomorrow I'll start a new project, I won't stop until I achieve my goals.


### Day 65 July 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a new project. I'll build an ecommerce website. To start I'm learning how to use dbdiagram to create my database, tables and their relations. I also started to design the web application.

**Thoughts**: I'll build this ecommerce website to learn how to create user logins, dashboard, and maybe try to implement a payment method with javascript full-stack.


### Day 66 July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I advanced in my new project of an ecommerce. I started to build the form to add a new product to the site. I learned about the vantage of using async await and promises rather than callback functions.

**Thoughts**: Async await let the code very clean. I'm so sad that I didn't learn this before. But now that I know, I'm improving my skills! 


### Day 67 July 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about arrow functions and how to get and treat files upload in my html with Javascript. The most difficult part is to find a way to remove the files with click. Tomorrow I'll keep trying it!

**Thoughts**: I'm studying too much these days, I really found my passion. Web programming is so good! See things happen is really incredible!


### Day 68 July 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to provide to the user a way to remove a file upload in html forms with javascript. I also started to use the middleware multer to use req.files in my backend. Now I can add any product in my project of an ecommerce.

**Thoughts**: Today I got stuck in a problem with the middleware multer. I did an arrow function without return true. So the app didn't work and didn't send any error message. I stayed at least 1 hour to discover where the error was. But in the end, all ocurred well, I'm very happy! This situation taught me about arrow functions and I won't commit this error again.


### Day 69 July 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about create procedures in postgresql. I created a trigger to update the timestamp every time the table updates. I also started to build the view page of the product in my ecommerce website.

**Thoughts**: I stayed too much time trying to build a sql function when I should build in my backend. Learn about procedures was cool, but I don't wanna do this anymore hahaha.


### Day 70 July 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to structure the home of my website and built the modal overlay when someone click in an image. I also started to build the search field of the site, tomorrow I'll finish it.

**Thoughts**: I learn new things every day, I'm so motivated. Yesterday I spoke with an expert in programming and he gave me valious tips. I know I can do better, I'll be better soon, I just have to code every day in the same rythm.


### Day 71 July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I built the search page of my site, I also implemented a menu to search for category of products. Tomorrow I intend to build or at least try to build a login system with node.js. I'll start with the register page.

**Thoughts**: I'll start to use notion.so to take notes. By now I'm using evernote but I think notion can improve my notes quality. I learned about zettelkasten and I'll use this method to help me fix my knowledge and to revise in the future.


### Day 72 July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was a great day of studies!!! I studied a lot and didn't lose my focus. I implemented a system to register users in my website and learned about sessions on ExpressJs. I used the library express-session and connect-pg-simple to link this session with database. I also learned how to create masks for fields and validate them. Tomorrow I'll keep doing my login system.

**Thoughts**: If all my days of study be like today I'll evolve much more faster and better. I was so focused and high deeply motivated that I only studied without see the time pass.


### Day 73 July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the login page of my website. I solved some bugs of express-session and created some validations for user logged in and logged out. Tomorrow I'll try to make a system of password recovery.

**Thoughts**: Javascript is the best language I ever used. I can do so much things and with high performance. I'll build a lot of projects to be an expert in web development with JS.


### Day 74 July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a session of password recovery in my project using nodemailer and mailtrap to test. I also learned how to use DELETE CASCADE on postgresql to delete my rows with foreign key on my database.

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow I plan to refactor my code until now. After this I'll continue creating new things.


### Day 75 July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started to write the documentation of the things I've been learning this past weeks. I wrote about node.js, single-thread, event loop, async functions, middlewares, etc. I plan to write a lot more about node, express, js and everything else to improve my knowledge retention. I also did some hackerrank exercises to keep practicing my logic.

**Thoughts**: When you start to study deeply nodejs you realize that YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING. HAHAHAHAHA. That is the true, I was doing my projects and thinking I know too much, but the true is that I dont know nothing yet, and it's wonderful, I think it's incredible that I have to much more things to learn, study and share.
