# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Goals: Build projects on python who automatize my tasks, and build a personal portfolio webpage.

### Day 0: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started learn OOP in Python, on this day I learned about class methods, instance method and static method. 

**Thoughts:** I really felt difficult on this first day learning object-oriented programming in python. I have programmed using OOP before, but in Java, and I don't remember much of that. For the next days I will read more and try to do simple projects to consolidate the knowledge.

### Day 1: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I learned about encapsulation and association. I realized that encapsulation in Python is very different than the others programming languages e more simple to understand. 

**Thoughts:** I still feel difficulty to understand some concepts, but I think this difficulty is because I didn't aply those concepts in a project yet. I'm trying to think in some project, when I get it, I'll learn more easier.
